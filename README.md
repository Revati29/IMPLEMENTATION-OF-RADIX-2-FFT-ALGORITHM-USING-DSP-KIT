OBJECTIVE
•To implement the Radix-2 FFT Algorithm on DSP Kit.
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a very powerful tool for revealing the useful frequency 
components of a signal, even when the signal is influenced by noise. FFT originates 
from the Fourier Transform (FT), a mathematical way to extract the frequency 
information by decomposing any periodic signal into a combination of sine and cosine 
waves. To adapt to digital signals, a discrete version of Fourier Transform is proposed 
and named Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). To compute DFT more efficiently, a faster 
algorithm was developed — the FFT
